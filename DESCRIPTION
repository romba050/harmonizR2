Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    The goal of this package is to help the user through the process of harmonization 
    following the Maelstrom Research standards. The user can:
    - Create an R environment where the user can place files in an organized structure
    - Identify the location and content of files in user's environment
    - Generate bookdown reports of study-specific variables (input)
    - Read and interpret the data processing elements (harmonization potential and 
      data processing rules) and generate harmonized dataset(s) (output)
    - Generate bookdown reports of harmonized variables
